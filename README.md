This application will generate a random password according to the user's preferences.
When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they will be prompted to select from four possible character types. They will be asked whether they want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers.
If they answer "no" to each question, they will be prompted to select at least one character option.
After they have selected their character types, the user will be asked which how many characters they would like in their password. This number must be between 8 and 128.
If the user enters a number that is too high or too low, the user will be prompted to enter a valid number of characters.
After the user has answered all prompts with valid input, their password will be generated and appear in the "your secure password" field.
